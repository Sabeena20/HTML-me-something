                    <h2>South Indian Chicken Curry</h2>
                    <p>Chicken curries come in many styles depending on where they're from. South Indian variations are rich
                        in aromatic spices and inevitably evoke memories of tangy tastes, like <a
                            href="https://bit.ly/3bYsfuC">sour kokum fruit and
                            sweet-and-tangy tamarind fruit,</a> in a mixture tempered by the smoothness of coconut cream.
                        Although
                        each region adds its own local ingredients, all chicken curries share the usage of yogurt, cream, or
                        coconut milk to thicken the dish and temper down the spices.This dish, while South Indian in origin,
                        is a variation on a classic, with an emphasis on fragrant whole spices and a generous amount of
                        delicious and silky gravy. <em><b>Rayyan's favorite is eating the parotta with chicken curry.That's

                    <h2>South Indian Style Dosa</h2>
                    <p>A dosai or dosa or dose is a thin pancake or crepe, originating from South India, made from a
                        fermented batter predominantly consisting of lentils and rice. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in
                        appearance, although savoury flavours are generally emphasized (sweet variants also exist). Its main
                        ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt,
                        then fermented. Dosas are a common dish in South Indian cuisine, but now have become popular all
                        over the Indian subcontinent. Dosas are served hot along with chutney by tradition and <a href = "https://bit.ly/3hWtDSm">sambar</a> in
                        recent times.<em><b>Rayyan's eats dosas for breakfast everyday.</b></em></p>
