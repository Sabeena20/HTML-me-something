                <h3>Kerala Malabar Parotta</h3>
                <p>Kerala Parotta or Malabar Parotta is a layered Indian flatbread that goes great with curries.There is
                    something about South Indian food that is so comforting and satisfying, that you crave for the
                    simplest of the simple meal very often.It happens with me all the time!There are days when I crave
                    for a crispy plain dosa with delicious coconut chutney, and then there
                    are other days when I just crave for a simple meal of sambar, thoran and rice.But there is one South
                    Indian bread, that I crave the most, it is KERALA PAROTTA.</p>
